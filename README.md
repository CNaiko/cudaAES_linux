# libgpucrypto

I did not write this, nor do I maintain a fork of this code. 

It took me a long time to find this code, as the original authors no longer share the source-code, however the license explicitly allows redistribution.

As a result of the above, I ham placing this code back in the public domain, in hopes that others can benefit.
